// "Fill empty space" — after a module is deleted/duplicated (the run isn't
// re-flowed), gaps and overlaps appear in a row. This grows the SELECTED module to
// swallow the empty space beside it, stopping at the NEAREST neighbour on each side
// (and never expanding into/over an overlapping module). Pure: the caller supplies
// the run's usable length so this stays free of the run-planning geometry.

// blocks BOTH the bases and the uppers beside it. Using a coarse "floor vs upper" lane instead made
// an upper ignore a neighbouring tall column and fill right over it.
//
// The band comes from model/bands.ts. This file used to carry its own near-copy that returned
// [0, h] for a base (no plinth, no worktop) — close enough to work, different enough to drift.
